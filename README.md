 # Go Benchmarks

### Overview
This repo started out as just a benchmark for various Go concurrent map implementations. Today this new repo aims to test various algorithms and data structures:
* Concurrent maps (COMPLETE)
* On disk sets (IN PROGRESS)
* Serde (IN PROGRESS)

### Running
`make bench-[map|set|serde]`

### TODO

#### Concurrent Map
[ ] - Rerun benchamrk on Go 1.24

#### On Disk Set
[ ] - Try skiplist on BadgerDB
[ ] - Try bbolt
[ ] - Try https://github.com/tidwall/buntdb

#### Serde
[ ] - Try Protobuf
[ ] - Try custom binary format
